## Agent / player profile related
With an outlook to integrating with Personas / profiles, how do I design the "Player profile"?
    In terms of structuring the relations, dependencies.

So let's say I want the "Player profile" be compatible with Personas somehow, and also, with other possibe games.
So the player (and game) related data could be ported. Hmm.

So, how to approach designing it?

### Questions

Why Note and NoteEntry distinction?
Because of data rivalry questinons?
